\section{Conclusions}
\label{s_conc}
As noted in \cite{NLT13,NLT18}, these solutions do not generalize to
dimensions higher than two. This is the most interesting open question,
in our opinion.

%"We" means Gruia
We believe that range trees can be replaced by ad-hoc methods to
obtain a $O(n^2)$ algorithm for exact RRL strip-rule minimization.
The savings of $O(\log n)$ in running time comes at the expense
of a more complicated algorithm which we decided not to present.
