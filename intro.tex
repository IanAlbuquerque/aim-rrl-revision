\section{Introduction}
We consider the following problem of generating patterns by drawing rectangles.
A target pattern is given as a grid of black and white cells.
We begin with a white grid and place solid black or white rectangles,
each rectangle covering any previously placed rectangles.
Placing arbitrary sized rectangles makes the problem NP-hard, so we
consider only placing rectangles that extend either the full height or width of the grid.
Our goal is to find the smallest number of rectangles required to create the target pattern.

\subsection{Organization}
We begin by defining all structures and concepts relevant to finding the optimal SRRL.
Next we give a detailed explanation of our $O(n^2$ log $n)$ optimal algorithm.
Finally, we state all theorems that make the algorithm possible and analyze the algorithm's time and space complexity.
