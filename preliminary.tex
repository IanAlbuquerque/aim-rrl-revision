\section{Preliminaries}

We begin by exploring the strategies and tools for finding an optimal SRRL. The Pick-Up-Sticks algorithm will detail the basic structure used to find an SRRL, but not necessarily the optimal SRRL. Then we will explain the concept of equivalence classes, which can be grouped into segments. All of these concepts will be put together in our algorithm for finding the optimal solution.
